Welcome everyone..🙏🙏

✔️ To get started with project download this repo and follow below steps accordingly:

step 1: 
	Download repo...

step 2: 
	Open the folder with vscode code editor...

step 3:
	Now visit this website 👉https://openweathermap.org/appid create your account and get api key.
 	⚠️⚠️ Please get your 👉API_KEY prior otherwise project won't work...
      	This will help you to get weather details for your area...

step 4: 
      Now open index.html file in root directory with live server extension in VScode...

**Note:**
✔️ To add additional function:
      Create a function in app1.js file which is available at mic/app1.js for example
      function createAlarm(){
          // Write some code
      }
      And then call this function in process.json with it's respective command for example...
      // In process.json
      {
      "AVA set an alarm" : "createAlarm()"
      }
      
✔️ Please allow the necessary permission required to perform certain task like
    camera permission for taking pictures,location for weather details, etc...
    
✔️ Sometimes AVA starting message/sound does not come so click on center so new small JARVIS window will come and then press 'ctrl+s' in vscode, this is quite annoying but this will solve issue...
